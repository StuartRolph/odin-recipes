    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The pie floater is a meal consisting of a meat pie served upside down in a dish of pea soup. It is common in South Australia, and sometimes seen in other parts of Australia. The pie floater is a popular midnight snack for drinkers and revelers. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 meat pie (commercial pies are fine)</li>
        <li>1 can pea soup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the pie in an oven. A microwave will not work as well, as the pie pastry will not be crisp.</li>
        <li>Heat the pea soup separately.</li>
        <li>Place the pie upside down in the dish, and pour the pea soup around it until the dish is full.</li>
    </ol>
