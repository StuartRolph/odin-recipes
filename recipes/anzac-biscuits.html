    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>ANZAC biscuits have long had an association with the Australia/New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops sent to Gallipoli during WWI. The biscuit appears to be a variant of the Scottish oat cake, said to be from the Scottish-influenced city of Dunedin. The recipe was created to ensure the biscuits would keep well during naval transportation to loved ones who were fighting abroad. The finished biscuits are quite chewy and crisp, and have a long shelf-life.</p>
